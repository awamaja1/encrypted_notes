## 🌟 What is VaultNotes?

**VaultNotes** transforms the way you capture, organize, and share knowledge. Built on the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**, it's more than just another note-taking app — it's your **personal knowledge vault** that you truly own.

> 💡 **Your thoughts. Your data. Your control.** No corporate overlords, no data mining, no privacy compromises.

### ✨ Core Philosophy
- 🔒 **Trustless & Encrypted** — Your notes are secured by cryptography, not corporate promises
- 🤝 **Collaborative by Design** — Share and co-create without sacrificing ownership  
- 🧠 **AI-Enhanced** — Let AI help organize and summarize your thoughts
- 🌐 **Truly Decentralized** — Built on Web3 infrastructure you can trust

## 📚 Documentation Deep Dive

### 🔗 Essential Resources
- 📖 [Internet Computer Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- 🛠️ [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- 🦀 [Rust Canister Development Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/)
- 📋 [Candid Interface Documentation](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/candid/)

### 🔧 **Advanced Configuration**

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# Production deployment
DFX_NETWORK=ic

CANISTER_ID=your_canister_id_here
```

#### Custom Actor Setup
For production deployments without DFX, you may need to customize the `createActor` function to avoid fetching the root key in production environments.
